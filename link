	2nd iteration of  testing for table with lines after bug fixing:
	
		Scenarios Covered:
			○ Table with proper horizontal and vertical lines
			○ Table Skewed
			○ Table with Blurred horizontal and vertical lines
			○ Multiple tables in a page
			○ Document Skewed
			○ Merging same tables in continuous pages
			○ Tables with only horizontal line in the heading
	
		Images:
			Solved Issues(s)
				§ Sample 8 --> Orientation problem (correct image is getting rotated)
		
			Persisting Issues
				§ Sample 4,6,7 --> 1 or 2 columns not getting extracted
				§ Sample 5 --> Not getting extracted properly (merged rows, missing rows) was working properly in the 1st iteration
				§ Sample 13 -- No data extracted 
				§ Sample 14 -- Not getting extracted
		
		PDF:
			Solved Issues(s)
				§ On the whole the extraction is not good.
				
			Persisting Issues
				§ Sample 3, DAIMLER AG SSI --> Content of column mapped with wrong rows, due to which extra rows are added.
				§ Sample 4,5 --> Rows are getting merged. (Image quality is very low)
				§ Sample 6,9,12,13,14, --> Some table are not getting extracted
				§ Sample 11 --> Some rows are missing
				
		
		MEAG:
			Solved Issues(s)
				§ Column values getting shifted. Last 2 columns getting merged
				§ Unwanted texts due to horizontal line near the table
			
			Persisting Issues
				§ Content of column mapped with wrong rows, due to which extra rows are added
				§ Headings missed out
		
		Tiff:
			Solved Issues(s)
				§ Sample 13 --> Orientation problem (correct image is getting rotated)
		
			Persisting Issues
				§ Sample 3, 4, 8, 10 --> 1 or 2 columns not getting extracted
				§ Sample 9 --> Last row not getting extracted because of the missing horizontal line
				§ Sample 12 --> Text blocks are getting detected due to unwanted line in the end of the document
		
		Total Good Samples  : 23(previous 15)
		
		Addressed Issues:
			○ Extra empty rows and columns
			○ Underline and strikethrough issue
			○ Extra rows and columns due to empty cells or split of rows
			○ Orientation problem (tiff sample 13, image sample 8)
			○ Unwanted texts due to horizontal line near the table
			○ Column shift and merge for tables without lines or vertical lines
			○ PDF issue (overall extraction)
		
		Persisting issues:
			○ 1 or 2 columns not getting detected (tiff sample 3,4,8,9,10 and Image sample 4,6,7)
			○ Last row not getting extracted because of the missing horizontal line in the end (tiff sample 9)
			○ Text blocks are getting detected due to unwanted line in the end of the document (tiff sample 12)
			○ Content of column mapped with wrong rows, due to which extra rows are added
			○ Content of column mapped with wrong rows, due to which extra rows are added
			○ Headings missed out (MEAG sample, with only horizontal line in header)
		
		Known Issues:
			○ Pytesseract issue
			○ Logo/Header identified as table
