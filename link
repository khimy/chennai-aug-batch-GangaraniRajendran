3rd iteration of  testing for table with lines after bug fixing:

	Scenarios Covered:
		○ Table with proper horizontal and vertical lines
		○ Table Skewed
		○ Table with Blurred horizontal and vertical lines
		○ Multiple tables in a page
		○ Merging same tables in continuous pages
		○ Tables with only horizontal line in the heading
		○ Tables with missing horizontal line in the last row
		○ Tables with strikethrough and underline

	Images:
		Solved Issues(s)
			§ Sample 5 --> 1 or 2 columns not getting extracted
	
		Persisting Issues
			§ Sample 6,7 --> 1 or 2 columns not getting extracted
			§ Sample 5 --> Not getting extracted properly (merged rows, missing rows) was working properly in the 1st iteration
			§ Sample 13 -- No data extracted 
			§ Sample 14 -- Not getting extracted
	
	PDF:
		Solved Issues(s)
			§ On the whole the extraction is not good.
			§ Content of column mapped with wrong rows, due to which extra rows are added.
			
		Persisting Issues
			§ Sample 14,13,9 --> Rows are getting merged. (Image quality is very low)
			§ Sample 6,11,12,14 --> Some table are not getting extracted
			§ Sample 8 --> Strikethrough texts are getting extracted
	
	MEAG:
		Solved Issues(s)
			§ Column values getting shifted. Last 2 columns getting merged
			§ Unwanted texts due to horizontal line near the table
			§ Content of column mapped with wrong rows, due to which extra rows are added
			§ Headings missed out
		
		Persisting Issues
			§ One extra row was extracted, which has affected the extraction of next row too.
				□ MEAG VLA A
				□ MEAG VLA B
				□ MEAG VENUS Multi Smart
				□ MEAG VENUS Long Short Strategy
				□ MEAG VENUS Asian Equities
				□ MEAG SP13 Absolute Return
				□ MEAG HMR 1 Renten 1
	
	Tiff:
		Solved Issues(s)
			§ Sample 13 --> Orientation problem (correct image is getting rotated)
			§ Sample 9 --> Last row not getting extracted because of the missing horizontal line
	
		Persisting Issues
			§ Sample 4,5,8,10 --> 1 or 2 columns not getting extracted
			§ Sample 12 --> Text blocks are getting detected due to unwanted line in the end of the document
			§ Sample 3,4,--> rows merged or not extracted
			§ Sample 8,10,14 --> Extra rows getting extracted
	
	Total Good Samples  : 40/65(previous 23)
	Image: 10/15
	PDF: 8/14
	Tiff: 7/14
	MEAG: 15/22
	
	Addressed Issues:
		○ Extra empty rows and columns
		○ Underline and strikethrough issue
		○ Extra rows and columns due to empty cells or split of rows
		○ Unwanted texts due to horizontal line near the table
		○ Column shift and merge for tables without lines or vertical lines
		○ PDF issue (overall extraction)
		○  Last row not getting extracted because of the missing horizontal line
		○ Content of column mapped with wrong rows, due to which extra rows are added
		○ Headings missed out
	
	Persisting issues:
		○ 1 or 2 columns not getting detected
		○ Text blocks are getting detected due to unwanted line in the end of the document
		○ Merging rows
		○ Missing rows
		○ Data not getting extracted at all
		○ Extra rows getting extracted
		○ Strikethrough text getting extracted
	
	Known Issues:
		○ Pytesseract issue
		○ Logo/Header identified as table
		○ Orientation issue
		○ Image noise leading to poor extraction
